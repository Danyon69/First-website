    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This was an absolute experience to eat. Made by a 
        culinarily inept flatmate, this is a perfect winter 
        warmer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't like spicy food, dont even bother with 
        this. If you do like spicy food, also dont bother with this.
    </p>

    <h2>You will need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chickpeas</li>
        <li>Can of tomatoes</li>
        <li>ALL OF THE CHILLI</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Curry powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Chop the onion into tiny little chunks
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a pan on medium-high heat until it is pretty 
            hot. Then add some oil of your choice. Flavour 
            does not matter for this dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the onions and fry until translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas, then add to 
            the onions
        </li>
        <li>
            Immediately follow this with the can of tomatoes 
            and a few hearty tablespoons of curry powder.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix this all together until it looks like it's 
            mixed.
        </li>
        <li>
            This is the <em>important</em> step. Add <em>at least</em>
            1 handful of fresh chili, or 2 table spoons of 
            chili powder, preferably both, and mix until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the "flavours" are being forcibly sold on the 
            slave trade market, add some rice to a rice cooker 
            and cook.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the rice is cooked, serve as you would a normal 
            meal, and enjoy.
        </li>
    </ol>
