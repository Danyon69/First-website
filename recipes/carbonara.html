    <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a frying pan on medium heat with a <em>tiny</em>
            amount of oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            While that's heating up, cut the bacon, 
            or fancy meat, into little chunks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Chuck the meat into the frying pan and stir so it
            doesnt make a fond (brown burnt looking bits that 
            stick to the bottom of the pan).
        </li>
        <li>
            Put a pot of water on to boil for the pasta, and 
            salt the water like it's the last thing you'll 
            ever salt. Once boiling, add the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the fat is rendering ou of the meat, start 
            grating up the cheese (about a handful per serving).
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you have some cheese, put it into a bowl (or big 
            measuring cup) and add the egg and a crushed garlic clove. 1 egg for each person 
            you want to feed. Mix to form a slurry.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you like it real spicy, add some freshly ground 
            black pepper to the slurry mix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain the pasta, keeping just a little bit of pasta 
            water (about a tablespoon for each serving).
        </li>
        <li>
            while the pasta is still hot, but not on any hot 
            element, add the slurry mixture and the bacon and stir vigorously 
            until a cohesive sauce is formed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately and eat it all, as you cannot 
            reheat this without scrambling the egg and ruining 
            a great sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
