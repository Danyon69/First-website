            Add the mushrooms and cook everything together until

        </li>
        <li>
            Boil some eggs until they are very soft boiled. 
            Then remove them from the water and run under 
            cold water to stop the cooking process.
        </li>
        <li>
            Peel the eggs carefully, as they will break easily.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the eggs to the ramen soup, and then add the 
            noodles.

            Once the noodles are cooked, the rame is ready
